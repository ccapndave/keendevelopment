  <p>I’ve been using the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/portfolios/">Wordpress portfolio feature</a> on my blog and website, but it turns out that portfolio tags are dealt with differently from post tags, as they are part of a custom content type with their own taxonomy.  I searched around for the theme code to insert a tag list but the best I could find was <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-portfolio-category-and-tags">this post</a> (which obviously worked at some point), but a bit of database examination showed that the name of the taxonomy must have changed since this post was written, and they are now named <em>jetpack-portfolio-tag *(and *jetpack-portfolio-type</em> for the type).</p>

<p>Therefore the code to insert a list of Wordpress portfolio tags into a theme is:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="nf">the_terms</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">get_the_ID</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="s1">'jetpack-portfolio-tag'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$before</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$separator</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$after</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>using the optional <strong>$before</strong>, <strong>$separator</strong> and <strong>$after</strong> parameters to taste.</p>
