  <p>I have just returned from the most awesome Flash/Flex conference which consisted of a bunch of techies all travelling to a tiny village in Switzerland where we spent the days skiing and snowboarding in the Jungfrau, and the evenings having presentations, eating great food and boozing :) The setting was incredibly beautiful and the linked <a href="http://www.alpineskimaps.com/swit/jungfrau/mapwin.htm">ski area</a> was massive, with loads of cool terrain to play in. The presentations were interesting and everyone was friendly and very very smart.</p>

<p>If you get the chance get along to the summer conference in Norway or next winter’s one which will once again be in Switzerland. It sure beats sitting in an office…</p>
