I developed a Ruby on Rails based Facebook application using RFacebook.  The
application lists upcoming birthdays for the user’s friends and suggests gifts
based on their profiles.  The application is database driven with admin panels
to allow the addition of locale based affiliate sites.  Cron jobs are used to
send out customized emails each Friday listing upcoming birthdays and the
project is hosted on a Capistrano administered Ubuntu server which I installed
from scratch.
