The goal for this project was to take the original [Road To IELTS](/portfolio/road-to-ielts/) project and make it available for iOS and Android devices. Since the original project was developed in Flex we were able to use Adobe AIR (then at a very early stage!) to compile version for these platforms and release them through the App Store and the Play Store.

This project was mainly based around Flex Mobile and AIR but also involved many targeted optimisations (both graphical and code-based) to maximize performance on these mobile devices.  It also involved some clever use of web vs mobile Flex in order to maintain a consistent codebase between the two versions, whist styling them in such a way to stay consistent with iOS/Android design guidelines. The techniques developed during this project have been standardised and extended so that all Clarity products are now available on the web, iOS and Android devices.
