The Dynamic Placement Test is a digital replacement for paper language level testing.  The test sorts students into their CEFR bands quickly, conveniently and affordably. Test items include a variety of tasks specially designed to exploit the capabilities of online, multimedia delivery. The test runs on the test takersâ€™ own devices and delivers results directly to the teacher's browser. Content has been devised by telc, the EU language testing experts and is endorsed by the [British Council](https://www.britishcouncil.org/).  The test is adaptive, and changes depending on the students performance in order to accurately gauge the user's level.

An important requirement of this project is that students should be able to take the test fully offline, and the project uses service workers to download and cache content.  In order to prevent cheating, the content is encrypted until a test starts.

The project is developed in Elm, with a smattering of Typescript and RxJS.
