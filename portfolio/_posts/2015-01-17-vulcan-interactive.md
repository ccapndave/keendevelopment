Vulcan Interactive is a real-time tool that allows legal teams to simulate
trials in order to gather detailed data about how jurors react to certain
arguments and issues. Trials are either held in hotels or conference rooms, or
with jurors connecting remotely, or a combination of the two. The client-side
software is built in Flex, with the backend built using PHP and MySQL. Real-time
data is handled with Wowza Streaming Engine extended by custom Java plugins. We
run a cloud of servers in order to support the requirements of this distributed
system, and deployment and management is handled by Capistrano and Chef. More
information is available at [First Court's website](https://firstcourt.com/)
