I developed a Ruby on Rails based Facebook application using RFacebook.  The application lists upcoming birthdays for the user’s friends and suggests gifts based on their profiles.  The application is database driven with admin panels to allow the addition of locale based affiliate sites.  Cron jobs are used to send out customized emails each Friday listing upcoming birthdays and the project is hosted on a Capistrano administered Ubuntu server which I installed from scratch.
