Results Manager is a massive Flex 3, PureMVC, PHP and Microsoft SQL Server
project, and allows hundreds of Clarity customers to manage thousands of
students.  The application also controls access and collates results to the
rest of the Clarity suite.  Report generation is managed using XSLT
stylesheets.
