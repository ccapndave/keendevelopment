This was an Actionscript 3.0 pinball simulator built for Nurofen to promote
the release of their new ‘Nurofen Express’ pills. The project makes use of
real-time physics and has a very tidy object-oriented design allowing the
addition of new tables and objects.  

I incorporated many features from classic pinball games that I loved, such as
[Pinball Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Dreams) and
[Pinball Fantasies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Fantasies) including
bonus multipliers, extra balls, multiball, jackpots and much more.
