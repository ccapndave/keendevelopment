Road to IELTS is a project developed in collaboration with [Clarity Language
Consultants](https://www.clarityenglish.com/) and the [British
Council][https://www.britishcouncil.org] which provides students with a
comprehensive online preparation course for taking the IELTS (International
English Language Testing System) exam including different types of exercises,
progress reports, mock papers and more.  This project motivated the development
of Bento, a frontend and backend framework that now underpins many of Clarity's
new products. This software is in use at universities and colleges all over the
world.  See more at [http://www.roadtoielts.com](http://www.roadtoielts.com).
For technologies, Road to IELTS uses PHP and MySQL and the frontend uses Flex
13.0, PureMVC and AMFPHP for client-server communication.  The exercises are
rendered using our own branch of the Adobe Text Layout Framework (TLF) which we
have massively enhanced in order to support a large subset of CSS and additional
HTML elements including form and audio/video tags.  We have also developed a
dialect of XHTML which describe both the appearance and functionality of
exercises and quizzes. Road To IELTS was awarded 'Best SME ICT (Product) Award'
in the 2014 [Hong Kong ICT Awards](http://www.hkictawards.hk/), with judges
highlighting its "robust and elegant" technical infrastructure.
