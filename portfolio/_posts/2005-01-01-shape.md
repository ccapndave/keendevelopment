I was lead developer on an innovative project called ‘Shape’ which was interactive whiteboard software designed to help teach secondary school mathematics in schools. The software makes extensive use of XML and has included the development of a Flash MathML parser, renderer and evaluator. The project also motivated the development of an Actionscript 2.0 MVC framework.
