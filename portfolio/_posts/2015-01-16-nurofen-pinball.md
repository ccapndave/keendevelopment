This was an Actionscript 3.0 pinball simulator built for Nurofen to promote
the release of their new ‘Nurofen Express’ pills. The project makes use of
real-time physics and has a very tidy object-oriented design allowing the
addition of new tables and objects.  It is a fully featured table based on
classic pinball games like [Pinball Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Dreams),
with bonus multipliers, extra balls, multiball, jackpots and much more.
