I was lead developer on an innovative project called ‘Shape’ which is
interactive whiteboard software designed to help teach secondary school
mathematics in schools. The software makes extensive use of XML and has
included the development of a Flash MathML parser, renderer and evaluator. The
project has also motivated the development of an Actionscript 2.0 MVC
framework.
