BetShopRoulette is a kiosk based Roulette machine, currently installed in
various betting shops and bookies across Ireland and shortly to be rolled out
across the UK.  The focus of this project is on good looks, reliability,
security and performance.

The system consists of multiple Flash based touch-screen roulette games
(compiled into a desktop application using AIR and running on All-In-One PCs
housed in cabinets), and a web based touch-screen cashier interface written in
HTML/CSS/JS using AngularJS and PHP with Silex and DBAL on the backend.  The
game server is written in server-side Actionscript and runs on Adobe Media
Server 5.

The promotional site for the product [can be seen here](https://www.kingbet.ie/)
