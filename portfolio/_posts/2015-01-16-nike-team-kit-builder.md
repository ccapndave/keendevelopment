This was a very large AS3 project application developed for Nike in
conjunction with RGA London. It allows the user to design and build matchday
and training football kit for their entire team.  The completed application
was first made available as part of an exhibition on the first floor of
[Niketown, Oxford Street, London](https://www.nike.com/retail/s/niketown-london),
then later converted into an online version.

The project made use of AS3, Flash, a custom MVC framework developed
specifically for the project, XML and E4X, Papervision 3D, Blender, PHP,
AMFPHP, MySQL and Smarty.
