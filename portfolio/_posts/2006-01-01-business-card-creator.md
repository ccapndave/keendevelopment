This project was similar to some previous work I did, but more sophisticated.
The user has complete freedom to add, style and place text on one of hundreds
of premade business cards. The business card is then converted to a high
resolution PDF for printing. This project makes use of AMFPHP, PDFLib + PDI
and SWFTools. Part of the project also involved the installation and
compilation of a dedicated Linux server. Â It also used Apache Xindice (an XML
database) to manage business card templates.
