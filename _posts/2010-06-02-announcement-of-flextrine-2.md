I am most proud to announce the development and upcoming release of Flextrine – an open source project I am developing that simplifies and encapsulates ORM with Flex and PHP.  Very simply, Flextrine maps AS3 objects to database tables giving you the ability to save and load objects to a remote database without having to worry about any server coding.  It supports all usual associations, local caching, indexing, Flex databinding and many other things, as well as having a nifty web interface for generating schemas and stubs.

Flextrine is planned for release on 1st September to match the release of its parent project Doctrine 2.
