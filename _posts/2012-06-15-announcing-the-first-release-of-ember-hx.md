I am proud to announce the release of Ember.hx, a library that enables ember.js programming via Haxe. This brings the structure, code completion and compile-time error checking of a modern statically typed language to the best HTML web application framework around. When I get some time Iâ€™ll be writing a few tutorials, but in the meantime check out the code and documentation, plus an example and live demo at [https://github.com/ccapndave/ember.hx](https://github.com/ccapndave/ember.hx)
