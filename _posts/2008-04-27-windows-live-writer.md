... is rocking.  I'm not usually one to praise Microsoft for their work but they've sure done a good job on this one.  Its apparently in beta, but it seems to be 100% stable so far.  It also has a nice plugin system to allow you to add various types of content to your blog quickly and easily.  I've just installed the [Insert Source Code Snippet](http://lvildosola.blogspot.com/2007/02/code-snippet-plugin-for-windows-live.html) plugin and it seems to work great.  Its unfortunately missing Actionscript syntax highlighting but C# is close enough for the moment and I'm sure it will be added in the near future.
