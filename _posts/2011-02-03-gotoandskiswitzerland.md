I have just returned from the most awesome Flash/Flex conference which consisted of a bunch of techies all travelling to a tiny village in Switzerland where we spent the days skiing and snowboarding in the Jungfrau, and the evenings having presentations, eating great food and boozing :) The setting was incredibly beautiful and the linked [ski area](http://www.alpineskimaps.com/swit/jungfrau/mapwin.htm) was massive, with loads of cool terrain to play in. The presentations were interesting and everyone was friendly and very very smart.

If you get the chance get along to the summer conference in Norway or next winter’s one which will once again be in Switzerland.&#160; It sure beats sitting in an office…
