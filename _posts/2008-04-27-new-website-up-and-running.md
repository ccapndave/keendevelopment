After many years of successful freelancing it looks like it might be time to have a bit of a website and blog. Its what all the kids are doing nowadays. Hopefully this will be a good way to pick up some new clients and in the modern spirit of open-source glasnost I'll be able to share bits of techy knowledge that might be of interest to the wider community (but without giving away any of my hard earned programmy secrets, obviously :) ).
