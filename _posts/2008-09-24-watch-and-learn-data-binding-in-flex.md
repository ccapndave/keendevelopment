My apologies to those of you who are watching my blog for updates - I've been working flat out on a number of exciting projects over the last few months including a plugin-based XML editor written in Flex which will be released as open source software in the coming weeks.

In the meantime I wanted to point everyone's attention to this brilliant lecture which explains Flex data binding at the compiler level and finally tells us what [Bindable] **really** does, why we need to use ArrayCollection instead of Array and all the other internals of Flex architecture which the official docs gloss over.
