I have released the first public version of Flextrine.&#160; Its actually pretty feature rich, and I will be focusing mainly on bug fixes and stability as reports start to come back from the community leading up to the main release on 1st September.

Major features that have made it into 0.5:

- Entities and the entity manager
- Single and collection associations
- The Flextrine Manager
- AS3 code generation
- Lazy loading, requireOne and requireMany
- Full Flex databinding
- DQL queries

Flextrine can be downloaded from Google Code at [http://code.google.com/p/flextrine2/](http://code.google.com/p/flextrine2/)&#160; Please try it out and log any issue you might find in Google Code.
