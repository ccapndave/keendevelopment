The Flextrine releases are flying out hard and fast!&#160; This release gives another batch of bug fixes, enhanced functionality in various areas, better error reporting and lots more API documentation.&#160; Flash on the Beach is just around the corner, and I’m hoping that my presentation will bring a new batch of users into the Flextrine camp.

**SPOILER ALERT** (only if you are coming to Flash on the Beach) – here is a sneak preview of my slides for the presentation [http://prezi.com/6vrft-2h4sjy/flextrine/](http://prezi.com/6vrft-2h4sjy/flextrine/)
