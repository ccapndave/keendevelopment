Another released of Flextrine! Since 0.6.1 there have been a number of changes to the Flextrine core. The entity merging algorithm has been altered to take better advantage of Doctrine 2 merging giving us a hefty performance boost (thanks for Benjamin Eberlei at Doctrine for pointing this out), the requirement to use `$_explicitType` in Doctrine entities has now been removed, bootstrapping and configuration code has been extended and neatened up and there have been numerous bug fixes at all levels of the application.

My continued thanks to the community for their help in testing and using Flextrine!
